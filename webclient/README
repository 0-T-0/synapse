Basic Usage
-----------

The web client should automatically run when running the home server. Alternatively, you can run
it stand-alone:

    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then, open this URL in a WEB browser::

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/


ReCaptcha Keys
--------------
The web client will look for the global variable webClientConfig for config options. You should
put your ReCaptcha public key there like so:

webClientConfig = {
        recaptcha_public_key: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"
}

This should be put in webclient/config.js which is already .gitignored, rather than in the web
client source files.
