Requires:
 - nodejs/npm
 - npm install karma
 - npm install jasmine
 - npm install protractor (e2e testing)

Setting up continuous integration / run the unit tests (make sure you're in
this directory so it can find the config file):
  karma start


Setting up e2e tests (only if you don't have a selenium server to run the tests
on. If you do, edit the config to point to that url):

  webdriver-manager update
  webdriver-manager start

  Create a file "environment-protractor.js" in this directory and type:
    module.exports = {
        seleniumAddress: 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub',
        loginUrl: "http://localhost:8008/_matrix/client/#/login",
        username: "YOUR_TEST_USERNAME",
        password: "YOUR_TEST_PASSWORD"
    }

Running e2e tests:
  protractor protractor.conf.js
